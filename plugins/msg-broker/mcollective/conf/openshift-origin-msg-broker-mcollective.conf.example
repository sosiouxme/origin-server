# Use districts when placing gears and moving them between hosts. Should be
# true except for particular dev/test situations.

# Require new gears to be placed in a district; when true, placement will fail
# if there isn't a district with capacity and the right gear profile.
DISTRICTS_REQUIRE_FOR_APP_CREATE=false

# Used as the default max gear capacity when creating a district.
DISTRICTS_MAX_CAPACITY=6000

# Place gears on nodes with the requested profile; should be true, as
